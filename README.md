# hello-world
starting my first repository
I am Simone Striani, recently graduated  from the Technical Univesity of Denmark in Sustainable Energy, study line in Wind Energy. Here I want to post my codes and some of the work I have done, especially in CFD, Load Aerodynamics and Control of wind turbines, with the hope of being useful to people who are on my same path.
This is a test for undestanding how to  use the repositories and the functions of Github.
